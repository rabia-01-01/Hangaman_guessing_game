# Hangaman_guessing_game
Hangman is a word-guessing game I often used to play as a child. In the game, one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is initially represented by dashes, and incorrect guesses result in the gradual drawing of a stick figure.
